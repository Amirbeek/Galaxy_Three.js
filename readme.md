# Galaxy Generator with Three.js

## Description

This project demonstrates the creation of a **Galaxy Generator** using **Three.js**, a powerful 3D graphics library for rendering stunning 3D visuals in the browser. The galaxy is dynamically generated based on customizable parameters such as the number of stars, size, spin, and color gradients. Users can interact with the scene using **OrbitControls** to explore the galaxy in 3D space.

The project uses **dat.GUI** to create an interface for adjusting parameters in real-time, allowing for an interactive experience.
